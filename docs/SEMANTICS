Values may be of one of 6 types:
 * undefined
 * boolean
 * number
 * string
 * object
 * function

The type 'undefined' has only one value, 'undefined'. The global scope
initially has a single variable, named 'undefined', the value of which is
'undefined'.

The type 'boolean' has only two members: false and true.

The type 'number' is an implementation-defined integer numeric type. Please
note that this differs from JavaScript, which specifies numbers are 64-bit
floating point.

A value of type 'string' is an immutable sequence of ASCII characters. Please
note that this differs from JavaScript, which specifies strings as Unicode.

A value of type 'object' is a hash table mapping string names to values of any
type. JavaScript's prototypes are not supported.

A value of type 'function' is a reference to a piece of code defined by the
grammar rule 'FunDecl := function ( ParamList ) { Statements }'. Please note
that unlike JavaScript, functions in SDyn may not additionally have members and
do not act as objects.

The global scope is an object and may be extended at runtime.

When a file is evaluated, its global function and variable declarations
(FunDecls and VarDecls) are evaluated, filling the global scope. Then, any
global calls (<id> ( ) ; ) are evaluated in the order that they appear. Global
calls may only be to functions with no parameters. Multiple declarations in the
global scope are allowed. The latest FunDecl is used. If a variable is declared
with VarDecl and there are no corresponding FunDecls, its value is 'undefined'.
Because FunDecls are the only way to declare functions, initially the only way
to obtain a value of type function is to access a function-bound member of the
global scope.

Each function has a local scope. The variables in this scope are those declared
in the VarDecls of the function, as well as the parameters. The parameters are
initialized to the corresponding arguments passed while calling the function.
If fewer arguments were passed then are required, the remaining parameters are
initialized to 'undefined'. All other local variables are also initialized to
'undefined'.

Statements are executed in the order they appear in the source.

The following coercions are built into the language, and will be used to
describe certain statements:

    ToBoolean(x):
        if x is undefined:
            false
        else if x is number:
            false if (x == 0), else true
        else if x is string:
            false if (x == ""), else true
        else
            true

    ToNumber(x):
        if x is undefined:
            0
        else if x is boolean:
            1 if (x == true), else 0
        else if x is string:
            The string is interpreted as a base-10 number. If there are no
            digits at the beginning of the string, the value is 0. If there are
            characters after the sequence of digits which begins the string,
            they are discarded and the value is derived only from the digits.
        else
            0 (Note that this is different behavior from JavaScript)

    ToString(x):
        if x is undefined:
            "undefined"
        else if x is boolean:
            "true" if (x == true), else false
        else if x is number:
            The number is converted to a base-10 string.
        else if x is object:
            "[object Object]"
        else if x is function:
            "[function]" (Note that this is different behavior from JavaScript)

    ToValue(x):
        if x is string or number:
            x
        else:
            ToString(x)


The remaining semantics are described in terms of the corresponding production
rules. In all cases in which the right hand side of a production is a single
nonterminal, the evaluation rule is to simply evaluate the right-hand
nonterminal.
